I"—<p>Turbulence phenomenon is one of the most challenging research areas in fluid dynamics. Even after decades of dedicated investigation, it remains as evasive as ever.  It affects weather, climate change, irrigation systems, fuel consumption, construction of bridges, artificial heart, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and rocket propulsion.</p>

<p>Turbulence is often cited as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œthe last great unsolved problem of classical physics. â€œ</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what makes turbulence so complicated? Some of the complexity arises from the wide range of length and time scale of the coherent structures interacting with each other.</p>
